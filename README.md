##Sane Blocker G

A python game using the *pygame* library (my first game with Pygame)

To run the game pygame is required 
 * *Pygame* can be downloaded from http://pygame.org

The game is running in a 640x640 area - sprites are 16x16 provided in the source/data folder

##Instructions:

With the help of your 'avatar' ![av](https://saneblockerg.googlecode.com/hg/source/data/avatr.png) you can move around and create blocks ![bk](https://saneblockerg.googlecode.com/hg/source/data/block1.png) (by pressing space bar) and then 'block' the bouncing balls ![bl](https://saneblockerg.googlecode.com/hg/source/data/ball.png).

NB : There are 2 kinds of blocks - destructible ![de](https://saneblockerg.googlecode.com/hg/source/data/block.png) or not ![nd](https://saneblockerg.googlecode.com/hg/source/data/block1.png)

There's even a demo https://code.google.com/p/saneblockerg/wiki/demo
